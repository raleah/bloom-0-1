# Specification
## Simple Summary
An experiment with cryptographic primitives.

## Abstract
The deliverable for this week focuses on cryptographic primitives including hashing, signing messages, and key generation. This deliverable is an experiment to build a ‘wallet’ in which those primitives are explored.

## Motivation
In order to better understand cryptographic primitives and the systems that rely on them, it is necessary to build a hands-on implementation using them. By building this ‘wallet’, different methods of implementation can be explored. 

## Goals
The goal of this project is to build a wallet that uses cryptography to create and read signatures, generate keys, and encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Plan
By making use of the different cryptography libraries available for Javascript, a ‘wallet’ will be created that can create and read signatures, generate keys, and encrypt and decrypt messages. 

## Security, Privacy, Risks
This is not a secure implementation and this code should not be used in production. It is only an experiment to explore cryptography and should only be viewed as such.
